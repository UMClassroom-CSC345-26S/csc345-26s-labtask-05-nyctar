# Two Ends of Knowledge

This labtask has two parts. The first is at the "low end" of Knowledge Representation -
checking for logical consequence in propositional logic. The second is at the high end" -
displaying ontological knowledge in a knowledge graph.

1. Logical Consequence in Propositional Logic

2. Ontological Knowledge Graph  
   On 20th January 2026 the Miami Hurricanes lost the College Football Playoff National 
   Championship to the Indiana Hoosiers, 27-21. Carson Beck was a member of the Miami team.
   Represent this using the terms:
   - `CFPNC_2026`
   - `Miami_Hurricanes`
   - `Indiana_Hoosiers`
   - `20_January_2026`
   - `27`
   - `21`
   - `Carson_Beck`

   connected to terms from the SUMO ontology.
   For example, `CFPNC_2026` is an `instance` of the SUMO term `FootballUS`, which is a `subclass`
   of `TeamSport`, which is a subclass of `Sport`, etc., which is a subclass of `Physical` 
   which is a subclass `Entity` (you must fill in "etc.").
   The knowledge you must capture is:
   - `Miami_Hurricanes` lost `CFPNC_2026`
   - `Indiana_Hoosiers` won `CFPNC_2026`
   - `20_January_2026` is_date `CFPNC_2026`
   - `27` winning_score `CFPNC_2026`
   - `21` losing_score `CFPNC_2026`
   - `Carson_Beck` played_in `CFPNC_2026`
   - `Carson_Beck` member `Miami_Hurricanes`
   - `Carson_Beck` instance `Man`
   
   The SUMO starting points you must use are:
   - `FootballUS` (for `CFPNC_2026`)
   - `SportsTeam` (for `Miami_Hurricanes` and `Indiana_Hoosiers`)
   - `Day` (for `20_January_2026`)
   - `NonnegativeInteger` (for `27` and `21`)
   - `Man` (for `Carson_Beck`)
     
   All the SUMO subclass hierarchies must end at `Entity`.
   Write out all your Thing-Relationship-Thing tripes in a text file `Football.txt`.
   Render the knowledge in a knowledge graph, and save it in a file `Football.png` (take a
   screenshot).
   Submit `Football.txt`, and `Football.png`.
